# simple_paint
A very simple paint program with line drawing (written from scratch by interpolating between 2 points on screen)  
Using **raylib** as the Base Engine with nothing more than *texture rendering* (which raylib uses glfw for) and *pixel drawing* (which also raylib uses glfw for)

## Running Yourself
No release build uploaded so far, so you would probably need to recompile from source,  
I use msvc so you would also need to setup that, and then run  
`build-windows.bat -c`

## Instructions
**left click** (hold) and draw to draw  
**right click** to clear the screen  
  
Pretty neato so far, might add more things if I really want to have some more fun with this!
